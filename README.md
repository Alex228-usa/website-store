npm start - run the app

npm test - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

npm run build - build the app for production to the bui
s folder

npm run eject - Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
